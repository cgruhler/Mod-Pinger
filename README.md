# D2 Mod Pinger
Have you ever wanted to fill out your mod selection from Ada-1 and Banshee, but you already have a majority of them? If you have, you've probably noticed that unless you check every single day diligently, you're likely to forget and risk missing out on a mod that you need. This tool aims to take the work off of you to check for mods, instead letting *you* know when a mod you don't already have in your inventory is available on a day.
